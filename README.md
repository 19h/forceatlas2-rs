# ForceAtlas2 Rust

Implementation of [ForceAtlas2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4051631/), a Continuous Graph Layout Algorithm for Handy Network Visualization (in other words, position the nodes of a n-dimension graph for drawing it more human-readably).

There is a binding for use in Python, [fa2rs](https://framagit.org/ZettaScript/fa2rs-py).

## Examples

[Install Rustup](https://rustup.rs/) and switch to nightly:

    rustup toolchain install nightly && rustup default nightly

A packet may be needed to draw graph:

    sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev

Clone repository:

    git clone https://framagit.org/ZettaScript/forceatlas2-rs && cd forceatlas2-rs

Build example: (`examples/wot.csv` file lists the edges of a directed graph, in two columns)

    cargo build --release --example csv_import
    ./target/release/examples/csv_import examples/wot.csv

Output images are in `target` directory.
